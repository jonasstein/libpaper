The libpaper package enables users to indicate their preferred paper
size, provides the paper(1) utility to find the user's preferred
default paper size and give information about known sizes, and
specifies system-wide and per-user paper size catalogues, which can
also be used directly (see paperspecs(5)).

The paperconfig(1) utility is provided to allow other systems that
have their own paper size configuration systems paper sizes, such as
TeXLive, to interoperate with paper(1).

Libpaper was developed by Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>, based on the
design of libpaper by Yves Arrouye <yves@debian.org>, improved by
Adrian Bunk <bunk@fs.tum.de>. It also supersedes the earlier “paper”
package developed by Reuben Thomas.


Installation from source
------------------------

To build, you need a standard POSIX environment and C compiler. Run:

  ./configure --enable-relocatable && make && [sudo] make install

The --enable-relocatable option builds libpaper as a relocatable
package that can be copied anywhere once built and installed. Note
that if you do not use it, the tests (“make check”) will not work.

For installation options, see ./configure --help; see INSTALL for more
information.


Building from git
-----------------

To build from git, you need the following extra programs installed:

  automake, autoconf, git

Then run:

  ./bootstrap

Then follow the instructions for building from source.
